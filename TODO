There are several things to do to improve this Emacs mode. Unfortunately,
I'm lacking time, and I rarely use F# these days. I've received a few
emails related to this project, and even some patches. As it's not yet
tested/integrated, I just copy here the messages I got.

Feel free to apply the patches, and fix the reported bugs.

  I'm asking this because there are many annoying bugs in the 0.2 version
  (e.g. many syntax highlighting issues (e.g. single line comment with
  quotes inside // ""), indenting a line with a "with" or "else" goes to
  an infinite loop, ...) and I'm considering fixing some of them, but I
  wouldn't want to waste my time fixing things that have already been
  fixed.

    I ran into problems with spaces in the file name. I was able to solve
    this problem in my case by replacing the following function

    (defun inferior-fsharp-args-to-list (string)
      (split-string-and-unquote string))

    in the file init-fsharp.el

    I must admit that I am not an Emacs Lisp expert, so I can just say
    that it worked for me but maybe it can be some help.

    The C-C C-R command has some problems with things like:

    1 + 1 // Hey I'm sending this to the inf-fsharp!!

    The ;; are appended after the comment. I made this patch that just
    adds an extra "\n" before of the ";;"
